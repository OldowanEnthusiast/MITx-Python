Hello, I am OldowanEnthusiast
I studied Archaeology at UCL and now currently at the University of Cambridge, reading MPhil Human Evolutionary Studies.

My primary interests are how lithic technologies and hominin anatomy, cognition, and behaviour influenced each other. Questions I often ask are: 

1) How and why did stone tools originate and develop over time with our hominin ancestors?
2) How and why are we cognitively and anatomically differnt from our living relatives such as chimpanzees?
3) What can stone tools tell us about the difference between primate and hominin cognition, behaviour, and anatomy?
4) How and why does these differences in anatomy and/or morphology affect biomechanical efficiency and constraints?

All in a human evolutionary framework and perspective.

My ultimate goal is to become an expert in Evolutionary Biomechanics and using computational modelling and reconstructions to further understand our anatomy and physiology.
Since hands are one of the most important parts of the body and have been playing significant roles throughout human evolution, I am becoming more and more intrigued by the human hand.
I think it would be amazing if I could use this novel approach to make striking and new discoveries regarding the evolution of the hand and lithic technologoies.
I also believe this research will contribute greatly to medical outcomes such as development and improvement of robotics, prosthetics, and exoskeletons, which is why I am doing this.

I am still very new to coding. I have only done the online MIT course: Intro to CS and Python, so I have much to learn!
I am currently trying to get better at coding especially in Python through Computational Neuroscience and more Python related online courses.
